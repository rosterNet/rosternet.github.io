        <h2 class="header-light regular-pad">Welcome to RosterNet</h2>
        <p>Most health plans would like to contact their contracted Providers on a quarterly basis at a minimum, preferably on a nightly or weekly basis, to synchronize individual physician information updates by its contracted Providers. Information to synchronize includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ability to accept new patients;</li>
            <li>Street address;</li>
            <li>Phone number; and</li>
            <li>Any other changes that affect availability to patients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most health plans (and the provider in their networks) find that keeping their directories ("rosters") updated across different institutions is challenging.</p>
        <p>RosterNet is a modern API and data network that partners with Provider System Vendors such as EHRs and RCMs, value added networks like Surescripts and Availity, and Providers to enable the automatic capture of clinician demographic data that is managed in Providers’ existing systems of record.</p>
        <p>The objectives of this automatic capture capability are: </p>    
        <ul>
            <li>Highest accuracy – source of truth for public, directory-related information</li>
            <li>Least disruption – no interruption in Provider workflow, annoyance avoidance</li>
            <li>Regulatory compliance – fulfills CMS objectives - contact, effective process, consumer access</li>
        </ul>
