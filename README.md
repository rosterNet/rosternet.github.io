# Free and open Platform as a Service (PaaS) for federated physician roster data exchange

The quality of physician demographics and which insurance plans they accept remains a challenge across the healthcare ecosystem. Even answering a simple question like “is a particular provider accepting new patients?” is not easy to answer. 


The RosterNet Platform as a Service (PaaS) gives health systems and health insurers alike the freedom of keeping their data in their own line of business systems but share it in near-real-time with their close partners or the broader ecosystem, including government entities. 

Significant cost savings are achieved through federated roster management shared services and open source software. You’re no longer alone.
