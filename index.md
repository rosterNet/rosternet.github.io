  <div class="content-sec"> The quality of physician demographics and which insurance plans they accept remains a challenge across the healthcare ecosystem. Even answering a simple question like “is a particular provider accepting new patients?” is not easy to answer.
  <br /><br />

No single stakeholder or institution can solve this problem alone. The RosterNet community was created to pull all participants into a single open source community so that resources--senior infrastructure and system architects with the skills needed to manage secure provider roster data--can be shared across institutions. </div>

   <div class="roster-centercontent">The RosterNet Platform as a Service (PaaS) gives health systems and health insurers alike the freedom of keeping their data in their own line of business systems but share it in near-real-time with their close partners or the broader ecosystem, including government entities. 
<br /><br />
Significant cost savings are achieved through federated roster management shared services and open source software. You’re no longer alone. </div>
